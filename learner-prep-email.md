Thanks for registering for the upcoming Ladies Learning Code workshop! There is no need to print a ticket or confirmation - we'll check you in electronically the day of the workshop.

We want to be able to dive right in and start learning at the workshop so there are a few things you need to prepare in advance below. Reminder, this workshop is BYOL so be sure to bring a laptop, power cord and computer mouse (if you're more comfortable using one than a trackpad).
 
HOW TO PREPARE:
 
1. Install Ruby

Mac Users:
Ruby is already on your computer. It comes with it! You just need to make sure you can open the application "Terminal". Go to Applications > Utilities > Terminal.

Windows Users:
(if you are on your work computer, you may have to ask IT at work if you don't have administrator privileges)
Go to http://rubyinstaller.org
Click the "DOWNLOAD" button
Click the link 'Ruby 2.0.0-p247' (or the most recent version) under RubyInstallers and save the file to your desktop
Once the file has finished downloading, double-click on rubyinstaller-2.0.0-p247.exe
Once setup is running, click 'I accept the License'
Click 'Next'
Do not change the default install directory, C:\Ruby202
Tick 'Add Ruby executables to your PATH'
Tick 'Associate .rb and .rbw files with this Ruby installation'
DO NOT tick "Install Tcl/Tk support"
Click 'Install'
Click 'Finish' when you see the completion window
If you run into trouble with these instructions, don't worry! Just arrive a few minutes early on Saturday (anytime after 9:15 am) and one of our amazing developer volunteers will help you out.
 
2. Download a good text editor: Atom Editor https://atom.io, or Sublime Text https://www.sublimetext.com
 
3. Download the Learner Materials here: https://github.com/ladieslearningcode/llc-intro-to-ruby/archive/master.zip
 
That's it! If you have any questions or comments there will be mentors available to help you on the day of the workshop. 
Looking forward to seeing you at the workshop!
